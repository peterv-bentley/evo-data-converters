## Evo

Evo is a unified platform for geoscience teams. It enables access, connection, computation, and management of subsurface data. This empowers better decision-making, simplified collaboration, and accelerated innovation. Evo is built on open APIs, allowing developers to build custom integrations and applications. Our open schemas, code examples, and SDK are available for the community to use and extend.

Evo is powered by Seequent, a Bentley organisation.

## Pre-requisites

* Python virtual environment with Python 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12
* Git

## Installation

The `gef` data-converter package depends upon the `pygef` package. Pygef should install automatically when evo-data-converter-gef is installed.

```shell
pip install evo-data-converters-gef
```

## GEF format

The GEF (Geotechnical Exchange Format) is a standardized text-based file format used for exchanging geotechnical data, such as Cone Penetration Test (CPT) and borehole (BORE) information. GEF files are widely used in geotechnical engineering and typically have the `.gef` extension.

### GEF CPT

This will convert Cone Penetration Tests to the Evo format.

### GEF BORE

This format will not be supported at this stage.
